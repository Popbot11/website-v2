        404 error<br>
        it's likely you followed a link that worked on a <a href="https://popbot11.github.io/website/">previous iteration</a> of this page, but has now been depreciated in favour of a more systematic structure. <br>
        if that isn't the issue, message me on discord (username: popbot) or email me at popbotmusic@gmail.com with a description of the problem. i probably just misspelled a url.
