for website redesign. 
reads from data.json and renders to html instead of me manually writing everything myself. 
this solution is much more scalable, but most importantly it's also a cooler implementation and is fun!

---
to add stuff to `entryData.json`, use the code snippets prefixes:
 - **entry** - adds syntax for an entire item object
 - **pair** - adds syntax for a normal pair
 - **contents** - adds syntax for the contents body (when tracklist is used)

there's also `personData.json` which is used to keep track of people's external links when they are listed as a collaborator in `entryData.json`
