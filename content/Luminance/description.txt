An old album from 2020. I originally only uploaded this to soundcloud. When I first uploaded it, this was the description that I wrote:<br>
<div class="indent">
Well this took quite a while.<br>

This EP features three friends of mine that go by the names of RetroReboot, Cranque, and Ryan Wheless, RetroReboot played the guitar in Mustard Stain, Ryan Wheless did some wacky sound design in Moss in Solitude as well as contributing a few things to Torus, and Cranque and I collaborated on AKM320 And Falling.<br>

Im really happy I finally got this out.<br>

Everything else that I want to say is just convoluted thoughts that I dont really feel like formulating into actual human speech right now, I might just edit this description later.

I then later edited the description with this:

Edit: damn, this was really rushed in retrospect. I remember spending like 25% of the time trying to perfect that one bass at the end of torus. Fun.
