             when i was 11 years old I was enrolled in a week long summer coding camp through a universety near our house called KidOYO. <br>
            this coding camp was my first exposure to computer coding; I learned basic coding concepts through python javascript and scratch, as well as some basic html and css. <br>
            The camp had/has a sort of custom site builder thing where you can have a website on the oyosite domain using your own html code. <br>
            I recently found the website through google results, annd figured it would be cool if I shared it here. <br>
            Keep in mind, i made this when i was 11. the website's contents are the writings of a 11-year-old pre-pubescent preteen. <br>
            also, I want to mention that the 'team websites' button links to the websites of some other people that were in my group in the summer camp. I made the team hub website (with the green square that moves around) but everything else except for that home page and my own website I didn't make. <br>
            anyways, here it is: <b><a style="font-size: larger;" href="site/index.html" target="_blank">old website</a></b>
        </p>

            there's also a bunch of oter stuff in this directory that is kinda just whatever, if you for whatever reason are intrested you can look at it in the repo for this page, i cant be bothered to sift through all this manually rn tbh i'm so tired.

            also, this is somewhat unrelated, but while going through the archive I found this insane "anniversary card" i made for my grandparents. <a href="aniverserycard.html">check it out</a>. (my password is different now, and my spelling has only slightly improved).
