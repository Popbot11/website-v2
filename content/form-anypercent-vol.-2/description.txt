Im a featured artist on the form any% volume 2 compilation. for this, a bunch of artists were given 18 hours to write a piece of music between 50 and 70 seconds. I initially wasnt going to do anything but i did offer to help out with some smaller things for people's projects if they needed assistance. around halfway through the event axis twelve and I started talking, and I ended up making the intro/outro, and a few of the percussion layers. he did the rest of everything. I had very little creative control which i honestly kind of appreciated cause on that same day I had started a remix which took a lot of creative energy since i havent done a remix in. actually i dont think ive ever done one. anywasy yeah thats the track!!!!!!!
