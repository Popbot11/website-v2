             I was 9 years old when i made this. Luckily I was able to find an archived version of this html, otherwise it would have been lost forever. I went through and censored a few things, but idk it's probably useless i feel like i'm pretty easy to dox lmao. 
             anyways, just felt like this was worth archiving if only because it's kind of incredibly cute.
