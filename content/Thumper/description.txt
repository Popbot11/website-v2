the first track i made in my sorta idm style. i learned a lot about stuff while making this. it was the first thing i made in the live 11 beta, iirc. <br>
I remember spending a while working on this and listening at very unsafe volumes to compensate for my lack of mixing skills, which I think is probably (up to the day when i'm writing this description, 2025-04-29) the worst i've treated my ears ever. <br>
listening back to this track today i still really enjoy the first section. it's interesting to listen back and compare it to what I was making before and after because I definitely see this track is a turning point in my style and ability.
