I had very little creative control which i honestly kind of appreciated cause on that same day I had started a remix which took a lot of creative energy since i havent done a remix in. actually i dont think ive ever done one. anywasy yeah thats the track!!!!!!!",

        "description": "I wrote this using pro tools for a midterm assignment. The class was called TECH 201; it's the class that people (such as myself) majoring in electronic music stuff usually take in their first semester. AMong other things like learning the basics of voltage controlled synthesis and the history of electronic music throughout the 20th century, we also had to learn pro tools. Ignoring the scum that is AVID, pro tools is actually pretty alright if you're using it for what it's meant to be used for. It's nothing like using ableton, bitwig, blockhead, or any other daw that I know how to use. pro tools' user experience is undoubtedly horrendous. despire this, i was still pleasantly suprised because i only wanted to end my own life for <i>some</i> of the time. \nim super mega insano style yapping right now. the vast majority of the sounds in this piece came from my singing voice and recordings of the synths in my college's studio with me. \nIt's nowhere near the same level of polish as what I normally enjoy making, but i'm not really able to export stems from pro tools into ableton to further polish it (which is insane btw. like 30 year old software cant fucking export stems? why the fuck). but yeah its finished and my rule is that if i finish something and i don't plan to include it in a larger project it has to go out. cause its not doing anything useful just rotting on my hard drive. \nhardcore raw html yapping rn \n I was going to include this on my bare branches album (which as of today jan 9 2025 this is not released and wont be for a while probably) but i wanna keep the tracks in the album to a pretty unified aesthetic, which excludes this track from making sense to be included on it.

            I ended up falling in love with the super simple but still "real" sounds that i was able to create with physical modelling. 
            I also wanted to experiment with writing off the grid, and given how "alive" physically modelled sounds tend to be, I thought it would be neat to
            try and make some music that sounded like an ecology of organisms conveyed through the super simple sounds that i had been enjoying. Not specifically
            ones made with waveguides-- just simple sounds in general.  
            <br> 
            Buoyant was the first track I made for it, everything else came after. I intended to have the EP last at least 10 - 15 minutes, but obv that didn't happen because i got bored of the style super quickly, and as such found it difficult to stay motivated. 
            Material like this (for me) requires an insane level of focus and time, which is really difficult to sustain for longer periods of time. I almost burnt myself out towards the end, and have just now sorta gotten out of it. 
            <br>
            I streamed a massive portion of the progress on the EP on youtube (probably at least 70% if not more), so if you're wondering more about the specifics of what went into the project you could check out one of the streams. 
            There are also a few streams where i'm working on tracks i decided not to include in the EP because they didn't fit or because i didn't like them.

        Specifically, it adds noise (and/or a specified external input signal) onto the portion of the input signal that falls above or below a specified gain threshold. 
        It's pretty okay at creating that nice crispy noisy sub sound. <br> 
        Above level and below level control the levels of the noise/sidechain for the signals that falls above and below the threshold, respectively. Smoothing controls how smooth the transition accross the threshold is. Mode interpolates between a subtractive mode (0) where noise is subtracted from the input signal, and a multiplicative mode (1) where noise is multiplied by the input signal. Crazy mode activates crazy mode. 
        <br><br>If you have any questions, lmk and i'll help you out to the best ot my ability. Keep in mind this thing is free and was made in a day, so it's probably got a whole lot of issues (such as working poorly with atency sometimes), and lacks a lot of features that people probably want.
