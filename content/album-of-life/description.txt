Description on soundcloud & bandcamp (written by myself and mleuc): <br>
Everybody lives once. This music is going to take you on a wonderous journey through lands never seen, saw, heard or even tasted (especially tasted). Get ready, prepare your seatbelt, for this is going to be one hell of a fabulous time!<br>
Born once? I don't think so... at least not like this! Get ready to live for the first time EVER in your life. It will be an experience of life. For this.... is the Album of Life.<br>

This is a shitpost album that came out of lukas and amfi figuring out how to synthesize some really funny sounds with physical modelling techniques. I somehow got involved. the majority of these tracks are lukas going solo, although amfi and I of course have a number of tracks on here. There's a lot of details about this (and specicific traks) that are so hilarious to me, but I don't want to overexplain this kind of thing. have a great day and remember to always go zurbo.
