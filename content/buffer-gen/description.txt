an unfinished non-realtime fully modular audio engine i made in Rust. This was the first project I ever tried to tackle in Rust, before i learned anything about data structures, so a lot of the way I structured that side of the code is a little strange. for example, i used a HashMap<String, Box<dyn Module>> to keep track of modules and Rc<RefCell<HashMap<String, Vec<f32>>>> to keep track of buffers instead of a graph or tree, which i imagine would have bene a lot easier to manage. I suppose my implementation of the HashMap was a sort of graph, but i wasn't thinking about it too much. obviously this description is retroactive; i'll probably have some further insight in the future once i get better at coding in rust.
