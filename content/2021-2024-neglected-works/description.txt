This is a collection of unfinished and neglected works from between jJly 2021 and November 2024.
I posted this on soundcloud using an alt account a couple months ago back in march of this year, and figured I'd go ahead and put it on bandcamp cause there wasn't really a reason not to, other than my mild desire to maintain a cohesive completion status on this profile.

I was in high school from 2020 to 2024, and would spend all of my available time writing music. I was an omega-hermit and usually managed to get my schoolwork done relatively efficiently, so I had a lot of time on my hands to sit in front of ableton messing around. A lot of this music was written in a single day after getting home from school. I will likely return to some of these tracks and re-interpret them a few years later. Some of them may turn into collaborations with other artists; in fact a few already have.


The cover image is a picture I took off of Saddleback Mountain in Maine. I think the lake in the image is Mooselookmeguntic Lake. My family takes annual trips up from our home in new york up to maine every summer, and we normally hike up this mountain during those trips.


If you wanna use any of these tracks for anything please let me know, I'd love to go into the project file and tweak the mix for you so that you can use something of higher quality than these somewhat crusty demos.

Thanks for listening :)
