wrote this about somebody close to me while not making enough space for myself. I wanted to finish this and include it on the creature ep, and then my current upcoming bare branches album, but I decided against both because the idea wouldn't really fit, and because i'm very unlikely to finish the thing now that i'm no longer experiencing the circumstances that led me to write this in the first place.
