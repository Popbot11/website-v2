A project i made in conjunction with buffer-gen. The intended purpose was to have an interface to create presets for buffer-gen, but it ended up being an intterface to create algorithms for mturboreverb. this was one of my first adventures with javascript, and as such, has a whole lot of issues.  
for context, mturboreverb is a plugin from melda that allows you to make your own reverb algorithms, but you can only do so via this pseudo-scripting thing. it's really really cool, but is sort of a UX nightmare (classic melda) because all of the names of modules in the syntax are between 1 and 3 characters.
