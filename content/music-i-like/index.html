I wanna gush about it but honestly i dont think anything i could say would do it justice. just listen for yourself. maybe close your eyes; it's very visual. </p>

    <p>2024-08-19 | <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/vorso/sets/holonomy">Vorso - Holonomy</a> | Bass music album that's been inspiring me quite a bit recently with my bass music related projects (especially .setique). Something about the way these tracks are structured is very very satisfying to me, which isn't somethign I hear too much in bass music. Granted i dont listen to too much mainstream bass stuff so my sample size is very small, but that doesn't matter because this is the album thats inspiring me, not something else. I feel like a lot of "experimental bass" or "idm" bass music really nails the sound design and flows and stuff, but doesn't often do anything unique or inspiring with the arrangements. So hearing this album is nice and refreshing in that regard. Track 14, shroud, is in my opinion the best example of this. Also, it goes fucking HARD, insano style. </p>

    <p>2024-08-19 | <a target="_blank" href="https://patriciataxxon.bandcamp.com/album/techdog-1-7">Patricia Taxxon - TECHDOG</a> | one of my favourite creative works that exists, currently. The tracks on the 6th and 7th albums are especially emotionally impactful for me.
        Her extreme control over texture and the way she is able to bring out very specific emotions with relatively simple and abstract sounds and movements is incredibly effective. There's a lot mroe I could say about individual tracks, but honestly just go out and listen to it instead. 
        Actually no fuck it i'm doing some more analysis right here and right now. But listen first. Or not. Do whatever. Spoilers ahead. Analysis time: <br><br>
        There's three specific moments that I wanna talk about, which i'll adress in chronological order. The first occurs at the transition between the fifth and sixth albums. The last track of the fifth album ends with a slow build into an incredibly dense noise pool of unfathomable weight, followed by nearly twenty seconds of perfect silence. The start of the following track (now in the 6th album) starts off with a pretty meaty transient, followed <i>immediately</i> by 10 minutes of more or less homogenious noise. Unliek the noise in the previous track, this noise can't really be described in terms of mass because even attempting to do so would likely cause this paragraph to collase into a singularity. Listening to this feels like I am *literally* being crushed. I *literally* was unable to move when i first heard this. It made by body feel weak. This is partially due to the contrast between the leading stretch of absolute silence, but also to the layers upon layers of slowly evolving textures that coagulate into this pure expression of weight and wrath. The effectiveness of this moment cannot be understated. <br>
        I was going to discuss two more moments (as i mentioned earlier) but honestly that was a lot of writing. I'll come back in a few hours after I get some sleep to do the other two.

I don't have very many specific detailed thoughts about this. It just sounds really incredible. You should give it a listen :)</p><hr>
     <p>2025-01-23 | <a target="_blank" href="https://dorianconcept.bandcamp.com/track/let-it-all-go">Dorian Concept - Let It All Go</a> | I rarely listen to music on loop, but I loove having this track on repeat. I've used it as a reference track for mix and texture for a while. Here's some unorganizd yappping about why I like it: <br>
        The stabs in the 2nd half directly inspire a lot of my own texture design and sound design. In terms of LUFS or other objective measurements, this track isn't very loud. But I think perceptually this is one of the loudest tracks I know of because of the way that it handles simplicity and contrast. <br>
        The second half of the track is magnificent. All the rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, contextual,  textural, textual, and timbral qualities work together to produce a string of moments that exude continuous release. The push and pull of the track feels entirely natural, like the only force that causes it to move originated from inside the track. That description kinda makes me sound a bit wacky style but idk how else to say it. <br>
        nothing wrong with sounding a bit wacky style from time to time. after all it'd be incredibly tone deaf for me to put up a facade of <span id="serious">seriousness</span>  on a website that looks like <i>this</i> lmao</p>

        2025-03-19 | Patricia Taxxon - Ten Skies, TECHDOG #66 | for my TECH 203 (multichannel audio) class at Oberlin Conservatory, one of our final projects was to write some composer profiles. I chose to write about patricia taxxon and keith rankin because i'm already very framilliar with their work. we chose two composers and 3 works (so two works from one composer) for which to write a formal analysis and also a program note. I'm just going to include the analysis here because the program notes are kind of awful imo. i also want to emphasize that i had to fill a word limit here so there's a lot of padding, and the writing in general is really poor because I was doing it in a single night with the help of an energy drink (which i have very few of; my caffiene tollerance is very low). im not including the writing about rankin here because it kind of sucks. <bR><br>
        
            
            taxxon's TECHDOG #66:
            <div class="box">
                <P>
                    *GEGCGEGHGEGCEDECEHCOCHCDHTHDHODTDODTOTOTOT* is the sixty-sixth track in Patricia Taxxon's TECHDOG project which spans 7 albums over 12 hours. Because of the insanity that is the title I'll be referring to it as "Track 66" instead of *GEGCGEGHGEGCEDECEHCOCHCDHTHDHODTDODTOTOTOT*.  
                </P>
                
                <P>
                    The track starts out with a single gesture / texture, who's timbre and motion is very evocative of pain. The tone is wavering and shrill, and has formants that are somewhat vocal. It's almost scream-like. It rises, "breaks" to a note almost an octave lower, and decays back into absolute silence. The entire track is composed of various permutations and interpretations of this gesture. Sometimes the gesture is accompanied by irregular gurgly bursts. As the track progresses, more uplifting diatonic harmonic passages begin to follow the "pain" gesture, creating an interesting contrast. 
                </P>
                
                <P>
                    The second-to-last occurrence of the "pain" gesture is 6 minutes long, which takes up the second half of the track. While all the preceding 15-second gestures had an attack followed by an immediate decay paired with varied irregular bursts and uplifting harmonic passages, this specific one is breaks the silence that all other gestures exist within by itself being of enormous scale in just about every respect. It has a much greater harmonic focus in comparison to any previous gestures, and is less obviously painful because of the major diatonic chords.  But this doesn't change or stop the painful nature of the previous gestures, it more so overshadows it. The incredible power of this single gesture is primarily a result of how well it contrasts (but does not necessarily oppose) everything that precedes it. 
                </P>
                
                <P>
                    In fact, the impact of most everything in this track is helped by contrast. So many important aspects are perceived as important because of the fact that they contrast other equally important things. The contrast between the presence and absence of sound emphasizes the extreme differences between emptiness and overwhelming cacophony throughout the track. The contrast between harmonic/diatonic information and purely timbral/spectral information emphasizes the presence of each, and makes the transitions between the two all the more impactful. Track 66 is able to communicate pain only because it exists in the context of pleasure, and pleasure only because it exists within the context of pain.

            ten skies:
            <div class="box">
                <p>
                    *Ten Skies* by Patricia Taxxon is a full 10-track album (technically 12, but the first and last tracks are silent) set to a 2004 film of the same title by James Benning, which is simply ten 10 minute shots of the sky. *Ten Skies*, the musical work, provides a sort of soundtrack to the video in that if lined up perfectly, moments in the video can be tracked onto moments in the music. A notable example of this is in the first track starting at around 7:08 when Taxxon first introduces some lower frequencies. In the film, this moment lines up with the first glimmers of orange and yellow in the bottom left of the frame as the sun rises. The newly introduced  low bass drone represents the beginning ascent of warm sunlight out of the dark blue early morning sky. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The music itself is extremely slow moving. Very few of the motions that can be discerned have an audible beginning or end, simply because they would be too long to be able to fit into the 10-minute duration of a single track. In Ten Skies, time moves at the exact same rate that it does in real life: because the film only represents a small 10-minute portion of a sunrise, so does the music. This is further helped by the fact that each track has an extremely abrupt start and end, as if each track is just a small snapshot of a much much much larger thing. Taxxon didn't even create small fades at the start and ends; she just let the audio click. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my opinion, this all serves to convey the unimaginable time scale scale that nature exists within. A 10-minute song, which is substantially longer than most songs, is not nearly enough to even convey a fraction of the whole of nature. The music itself is so beautiful, so to think that it only represents ~100 minutes of infinity is very uplifting. 
                </p>

                i wanna add something that i didnt write in this "analysis" for school, but it feels somewhat important now. For me , this music also has maybe some maningful ties with non-human-ness (?). As somebody who is currently (2024-05-24 12:44 am) contemplating and experimenting with their own non-human identety, the messaging about the continuum of nature makes me feel as if I'm more intimately a part of it all. Which is a pretty validating thing to feel. More generally, the idea that the majority of what humans have built is probably going to be gone within a few thousand years, when viewed through the lens of nature not really giving a shit, is really reassuring. You could look at earth in 100 million years from now and the clouds will still be just as beautiful.

        Most of what i have to say about this release is concerned with the mixdown.  Imo the mixdown in this track is as close to perfect you can get when it comes to this sort of thing. Every single element has its own little pocket. This is a pretty clicke saying, but in this context I think it's really easy to pick up on. <br>
        This type of music is extremely detailed, which i think is a really important part of the genre (for me at least). This genre thrives off of maximalism. These two songs, though, are kind of an exception to that because I percieve them as being <i>really</i> simple in composition. All of the ideas being thrown around are incredibly simple, but are just executed sooooo perfectly. <br>
        where the detail comes through is in all of the little percussive layers. What i appreciate is that every percussive layer has a distinct purpose and place within the mix. It is the case that for every single element, if you were to remove it, the track would sound incomplete. <br>
        this is the sort of thing i really want to be able to do myself when mixing, especially as somebody who almost always trends towards extremely maximalist composition.
