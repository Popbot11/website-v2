Three aesthetically similar tunes that I initially didn't think to include on an EP but later decided to. I made the majority of this while in google meets in remote learning, not paying attention. <br><br>
The idea behind these three tracks was that I wanted to spend a single week on each one and release each at the end of the week. as you can see from the release dates this plan didn't really hold for very long, but i did get 3 tracks out of it. <br><br>
i wanted to do a single track in a week because I was dissapointed in myself for having just spent 3 months on thumper, and wanted to speed up my workflow. <br><br>
for these tracks and a few ones after I remember using this awful method of sidechain where I had the shaper m4l device with a sidechain curve mapped to the input gain of ableton's saturator device (which wasn't doing clean saturation fyi). Instead of doing a single saturator on a big group, i would just take this rack and put it at the end of every track that I wanted to sidechain. to me this is just really fucking funny because of how awful it is. but it clearly  worked, and i've clearly learned why that method is so awful.
